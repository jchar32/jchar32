Currently, I am a post-doctoral fellow working in biomedical engineering and kinesiology. My research involves aspects of human motion analysis (optical, inertial), sensorimotor integration, experimental pain, and movement variability. I have a background in clinical biomechanics, involving movement modification and gait biomechanics aimed at knee osteoarthritis rehabilitation. 

Given the nature of the data I deal with, I have developed a number of programs to manage, analyze, and visualize gait biomechanics.

My github page is a place where I am storing a lot of this work that might be helpful for other students and researchers dealing with these data.
You will also find some personal pet-projects on here relating to inertial sensing, dashboards, data analytics, and web-development.

I primarily work with Python, MATLAB, Labview, and R Stats, while I dabble in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
