Hi, I am Jesse Charlton.

At the moment I am a doctoral candidate studying the biomechancis of walking. I use optical and inertial motion capture technology along with clinical research methods to evaluate and develop interventions for musculoskeletal disease, mainly knee osteoarthritis.
Given the nature of the data I deal with, I have developed a number of programs to manage, analyze, and visualize gait biomechanics. 
My github page is a place where I am storing a lot of this work that might be helpful for other students and researchers dealing with these data.
You will also find some personal pet-projects on here relating to web-development.

I primarily work with MATLAB at the moment, am learning python, and dabbling in htlm, css, and javascript.
