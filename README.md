Hi, I am Jesse Charlton.

Currently I am a doctoral candidate studying the biomechanics of walking and musculoskeletal disease. I use optical and inertial motion capture technology along with clinical research methods to evaluate and develop interventions for musculoskeletal disease, mainly knee osteoarthritis.
Given the nature of the data I deal with, I have developed a number of programs to manage, analyze, and visualize gait biomechanics. 
My github page is a place where I am storing a lot of this work that might be helpful for other students and researchers dealing with these data.
You will also find some personal pet-projects on here relating to inertial sensing, dashboards, data analytics, and web-development.

I primarily work with MATLAB and R Stats, Though I am learning python, and dabbling in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
