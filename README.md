# Jesse Charlton, PhD

`Research Scientist [neuromechanics / motor control / rehabilitation]`

I study how and why we move, and the consequences of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular disease. Through my GitHub, I hope to provide helpful resources and code to others working with biomechanics or related scientific endeavours.
